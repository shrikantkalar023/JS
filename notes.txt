Use let when need variable var & const when need constant var.

to iterate in object use forin loop.

Single Responsibility Principle: Each fn doing its own one thing.

'radius: radius' is equivalent to 'radius' (inside a fn)

camel Case -> oneTwoThree
Pascal Case -> OneTwoThree

Every Obj has a Constructor property
which references the fn used to create that obj

for-of loop works with iterables only.Objs r not iterable, but
we can use Objects.keys(Obj_name) or Object.entries(obj_name)
to get array of keys & key,value pair respectively.

We have math & str obj just like in py.
